# Incident-Response-Plan

This incident response plan outlines our financial institution’s strategy for managing 
cybersecurity incidents, with the primary objectives of protecting critical assets, maintaining 
customer trust, and ensuring business continuity. It features a dedicated incident response 
team with clearly defined roles, following NIST 800-61r2 guidelines. Our approach includes 
a four-phase process: Preparation involves developing necessary policies, procedures, and 
technical capabilities; Detection and Analysis focuses on identifying and assessing breaches 
through continuous monitoring; Containment, Eradication, and Recovery aim to swiftly
isolate affected systems, eliminate threats, and restore normal operations; and Post-Incident 
Activity centers on reviewing and enhancing our response capabilities and overall security 
posture.
Additionally, the plan includes detailed checklists and procedures tailored to our specific 
needs and regulatory requirements. A robust communication strategy ensures timely 
information sharing with stakeholders, customers, regulators, and law enforcement. Regular 
testing and updates are integral to maintaining the plan’s effectiveness against emerging 
threats. Overall, this plan is designed to minimize the impact of security incidents, safeguard 
customer information, and ensure compliance with industry regulations, reflecting our 
commitment to proactive and effective cybersecurity practices.
